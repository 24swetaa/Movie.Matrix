# Movie-Matrix ðŸŽ¬

_Movie Recommendation System_

A movie suggestion from the server-based system has made discovering a good movie much easier these days. Movie recommendations assist cinephiles and movie fans by proposing top-tier films to watch without wasting time searching through large databases. To solve this problem, I propose a content-based model that will use Python-based Machine Learning algorithms to analyse large datasets and generate a movie recommendation.

**Movie Matrix** is a web application which recommends similar movies to a movie the user likes.

## To run the project:
- Clone the repository into your local machine.
- Install all the dependencies for web app. (Refer to the install dependencies section).
- Unzip similarlity.pkl file present in recommendation-system folder and movie-recommender-system folder.
- Get your API key. (Refer to the To get API key section).
- Then replace api_key in line 30 of recommendation system/movie-recommender-system (open in PyCharm or any other IDE).
- Run the following command :
  ``` streamlit run app.py ```
- Go to http://localhost:8501 on your browser.

## Approach:
The problem was divided into several steps:
  > Dataset Collection:
  
       Dataset was collected from TMDB 5000 movie dataset from the Kaggle website.
  > Data Wrangling:
       
       Null values and duplicate entries were dropped from the dataset.
  > Data Preprocessing:

       Created a new data frame by removing unnecessary columns and made tags for a particular movie by
       concatenating columns.
  > Model building:

       Implemented Content-based filtering (Recommendation algorithm). Movies were transformed into vectors.
       Cosine Similarity function from the scikit-learn module of python was used to give similarity scores. 
       Similarity scores were given to all movies when compared with a particular movie. The greater the 
       similarity score, the more chance for its recommendation.

   > Web App:

      Built a web app in PyCharm by importing Streamlit module. Connected the data frame with the web app 
      using pickle library functions.Fetched posters of the movie through TMDB API. Implemented a chatbot
      using PyTorch-Transformers.

  <a name = "features"></a>
  ## Features:
  - On selecting a movie 8 similar movies are recommended along with their posters.
  - For more information user can click the title and through a link, it will get directed to the TMDB website for movie details.
  - A chatbot for interacting with the user. It can answer the various question of the user related to movie recommendations
  - Contact information for communication purposes.
