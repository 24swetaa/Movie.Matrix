# Movie-Matrix ðŸŽ¬

_Movie Recommendation System_

A movie suggestion from the server-based system has made discovering a good movie much easier these days. Movie recommendations assist cinephiles and movie fans by proposing top-tier films to watch without wasting time searching through large databases. To solve this problem, I propose a content-based model that will use Python-based Machine Learning algorithms to analyse large datasets and generate a movie recommendation.

**Movie Matrix** is a web application which recommends similar movies to a movie the user likes.

## About dataset:
* TMDB ~5000 movie dataset [TMDB 5000 movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata).
* The data contained following files:
  ```
  tmdb_5000_credits.csv
  tmdb_5000_movies.csv
  ```

## Approach:
The problem was divided into several steps:
  > Dataset Collection:
  
       Dataset was collected from TMDB 5000 movie dataset from the Kaggle website.
  > Data Wrangling:
       
       Null values and duplicate entries were dropped from the dataset.
  > Data Preprocessing:

       Created a new data frame by removing unnecessary columns and made tags for a particular movie by
       concatenating columns.
  > Model building:

       Implemented Content-based filtering (Recommendation algorithm). Movies were transformed into vectors.
       Cosine Similarity function from the scikit-learn module of python was used to give similarity scores. 
       Similarity scores were given to all movies when compared with a particular movie. The greater the 
       similarity score, the more chance for its recommendation.

   > Web App:

      Built a web app in PyCharm by importing Streamlit module. Connected the data frame with the web app 
      using pickle library functions.Fetched posters of the movie through TMDB API. Implemented a chatbot
      using PyTorch-Transformers.

  ## Features:
  - On selecting a movie 8 similar movies are recommended along with their posters.
  - For more information user can click the title and through a link, it will get directed to the TMDB website for movie details.
  - A chatbot for interacting with the user. It can answer the various question of the user related to movie recommendations
  - Contact information for communication purposes.
